```

## Prerequisites

- Bazel 8.4+
- Go 1.24.2+ (for Bazel Go SDK)
- [Task](https://taskfile.dev) (optional, for development tasks)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Build all code
bazel build //years/2025/...

# Run all tests
bazel test //years/2025/...

# Run gazelle to update BUILD files after adding new Go code
bazel run //:gazelle -- -r .

# Update dependencies
bazel mod tidy
go work sync
```

## Adding New Days

1. Create a new directory under `years/2025/dayX/` with your Go files
2. Run `bazel run //:gazelle -- -r .` to generate BUILD.bazel files
3. Run `bazel mod tidy` to update dependencies if needed

## Current Status

- **2025**: Migrated and working (7/8 tests passing, 1 known failure in day7)
- **2024**: To be migrated in future phase
- **2023**: To be migrated in future phase

## Notes

- Each year is a separate Go module for dependency isolation
- Some tests may fail - this is expected and reflects the state of the original projects
- BUILD.bazel files are auto-generated by gazelle - don't edit them manually
